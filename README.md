# MPWarfare
I have been working on a game in my Research in IT Solutions class. 
This game, MPWarfare, is fun multiplayer game I developed on unreal engine. 
This game has multiple game modes, Team Deathmatch, Deathmatch, Classic, and Micro Battle Royale.
The blueprints for the game was bought from bv01d and have been really helpful. 
This is a very interactive game with well-developed maps.
It is a very simple and easy to play game yet very fun at the same time to play with friends and family.
Gore is minimal making the game very family-friendly. 
It has been very fun using Unreal Engine and explore a new form of game development. 
I hope you all enjoy this game. 

The game can be played at the following link:
